                Hello! My name is Emanuel Sch√§fer, and I'm a frontend developer.
                I have been living in Paraguay for 2.5 years and originally come from Ulm, Germany.
                I take joy in creating things from nothing. Driven by innovation,
                my goal is to contribute to solutions that are both modern and user-focused.

                    I learned my skills at the Developer Academy,
                    where feedback from mentors transformed my passion into precision.
                    This is where I really learned to combine form and function to create accessible and engaging web experiences.

                    Beyond the world of code, I find balance and discipline through playing handball.
                    The teamwork, strategy and resilience required on the pitch also flow into my professional ethics.
